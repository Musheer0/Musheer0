## 👋 yo, I’m Musheer

I build stuff. Break stuff. Fix stuff. Repeat.

- 💻 Coding since **12th holidays** (aka when life still had free time)
- 🧠 Everything here is **self-taught**  
  YouTube • ChatGPT • Docs • Trial & error  
  **College taught me attendance**, not code.
- 🐧 I use **Arch Linux btw** 
---

## 🧰 Tech I actually use (not résumé filler)

**Frontend**
- Next.js

**Backend**
- NestJS
- FastAPI

**Languages**
- JavaScript
- Python
- Go
- C

---
## 🧠 How I learn (real pipeline)

1. Read docs → confused
2. Watch YouTube → half confident
3. Ask ChatGPT → overconfident
4. Build project → humbled
5. Debug → enlightenment

Repeat until it works.

No “follow-along tutorial merchant” behavior here.

## ⚡ Fun facts
- You don’t need a *special tutorial* to learn TypeScript  
  (it’s literally JavaScript with some sanity)
- I learn faster by **building**, not memorizing buzzwords

---

## 📌 Currently
- Building some dumb projects
- Going deeper into backend, frontend, and systems

> If it works, ship it.  
> If it breaks, debug it.  
> If college didn’t teach it, I learned it anyway.
